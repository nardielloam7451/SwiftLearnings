# SwiftLearnings
A repository for learning more about Swift, SwiftUI, and developing for Apple platform. I want to actually develop and learn these skills, so I can learn more and grow as an iOS Developer.

## Goals
1. I want to learn iOS development so I can improve my skills as a developer, and learn things in order to take my career into the directions that I want. 

2. Developing these skills will allow me to bring my apps that I want into the world, using the techniques and functionality that I actually want.
